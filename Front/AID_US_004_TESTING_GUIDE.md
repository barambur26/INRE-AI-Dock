# AID-US-004 Testing Guide: Unified Chat Interface

## 🎯 **Overview**
Complete testing guide for the unified chat interface functionality. This covers both backend APIs and frontend chat interface with full LLM integration.

## 🚀 **Prerequisites**

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd /Users/blas/Desktop/INRE/INRE-AI-Dock/Back
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend Setup  
```bash
cd /Users/blas/Desktop/INRE/INRE-AI-Dock/Front
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables (Optional)
For testing with real LLM providers, set in `/Back/.env`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

## 📋 **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Basic Chat Flow (Happy Path)**
**Objective:** Test complete chat workflow with default LLM

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
2. Login with credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. Click "Chat Interface" button on Dashboard
4. Verify chat interface loads properly
5. Send a simple message: "Hello, how are you?"
6. Verify LLM response appears
7. Check usage statistics are updated

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Chat interface loads without errors
- ✅ Model indicator shows active LLM (OpenAI by default)
- ✅ Message appears in chat history
- ✅ LLM response is received and displayed
- ✅ Quota usage is updated in real-time
- ✅ Usage statistics reflect the interaction

### **Test 2: Multiple Message Conversation**
**Objective:** Test conversation continuity and memory

**Steps:**
1. Continue from Test 1 (already in chat)
2. Send follow-up message: "What did I just ask you?"
3. Send another message: "Can you help me with a coding question?"
4. Send code request: "Write a simple Python function to add two numbers"
5. Verify all messages appear in chronological order

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Messages appear in correct order with timestamps
- ✅ User and assistant messages are visually distinct
- ✅ Auto-scroll works correctly
- ✅ All responses are contextually appropriate
- ✅ Token usage accumulates correctly

### **Test 3: Service Health and Model Information**
**Objective:** Verify system status monitoring

**Steps:**
1. In chat interface, observe the model indicator bar
2. Note the provider icon and model name
3. Check quota usage visualization
4. Click "Refresh" button in header
5. Verify service status updates

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Model indicator shows correct provider (🤖 for OpenAI)
- ✅ Model name and provider are displayed
- ✅ Quota bar shows usage percentage visually
- ✅ Refresh updates all information
- ✅ Service status shows "Quota OK" (green)

### **Test 4: Error Handling - No API Key**
**Objective:** Test error handling when LLM is unavailable

**Steps:**
1. Stop the backend temporarily
2. Try sending a message in the chat
3. Restart backend
4. Try sending a message again

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Error message appears when backend is unavailable
- ✅ Error message is user-friendly (not technical)
- ✅ Chat recovers when backend returns
- ✅ No loss of chat history
- ✅ Proper loading states shown

### **Test 5: Input Validation and Limits**
**Objective:** Test message input validation

**Steps:**
1. Try sending an empty message
2. Send a very long message (> 10,000 characters)
3. Test keyboard shortcuts:
   - Press Enter to send
   - Press Shift+Enter for new line
4. Test message with special characters and emojis

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Empty messages cannot be sent
- ✅ Character counter shows current count
- ✅ Messages over limit are blocked
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts work correctly
- ✅ Special characters and emojis are handled properly

### **Test 6: Responsive Design and Mobile**
**Objective:** Test interface on different screen sizes

**Steps:**
1. Resize browser window to mobile width (< 768px)
2. Verify chat interface adapts
3. Test sending messages on mobile view
4. Check if all functionality remains accessible

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Interface adapts to smaller screens
- ✅ Message input remains usable
- ✅ Navigation buttons are accessible
- ✅ Text remains readable
- ✅ Touch interactions work properly

### **Test 7: Authentication and Access Control**
**Objective:** Test authentication integration

**Steps:**
1. Logout from current session
2. Try accessing `/chat` directly while logged out
3. Login with different user credentials:
   - Username: `user1`
   - Password: `user123`
4. Access chat interface as regular user
5. Verify admin features are not visible

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Direct access to `/chat` redirects to login
- ✅ Login is required for chat access
- ✅ Regular users can access chat
- ✅ Admin-specific features are hidden for non-admins
- ✅ User info displayed correctly in header

### **Test 8: Real-Time Features**
**Objective:** Test dynamic updates and loading states

**Steps:**
1. Send a longer, complex message
2. Observe loading indicators during processing
3. Watch auto-scroll behavior
4. Check timestamp accuracy
5. Verify quota updates in real-time

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Loading spinner appears while waiting for response
- ✅ "AI is thinking..." indicator shows
- ✅ Messages auto-scroll to bottom
- ✅ Timestamps are accurate and formatted well
- ✅ Quota information updates immediately after response

### **Test 9: Navigation and Integration**
**Objective:** Test integration with other parts of the application

**Steps:**
1. From chat interface, click "Admin" (if admin user)
2. Navigate back to Dashboard
3. Return to chat interface
4. Verify chat history is preserved
5. Test logout from chat interface

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Navigation between pages works smoothly
- ✅ Chat state is preserved during navigation
- ✅ Admin access works correctly
- ✅ Logout functionality works from chat
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation is clear

### **Test 10: Backend API Testing (Advanced)**
**Objective:** Test backend APIs directly

**Steps:**
1. Login and get access token:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'
```

2. Test chat health:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/health"
```

3. Get available models:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/models" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

4. Send test message:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/send" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Test API message"}'
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All API endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ Authentication is required for protected endpoints
- ✅ JSON responses are properly formatted
- ✅ Error responses include helpful messages
